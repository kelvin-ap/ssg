        <h1>Lazarus X_TRADER Hack Impacts Critical Infrastructure Beyond 3CX Breach</h1>

          <p>
            North Korean hacking group Lazarus breached two critical infrastructure organizations in the power and energy sector and 
            two other financial trading businesses using trojanized X_TRADER application. Symantec's Threat Hunter Team confirmed 
            earlier suspicions that the X_TRADER application compromise affected more organizations than 3CX. The impact from these 
            infections is unknown at this time, and investigations are ongoing.

            Mandiant disclosed that the compromise of the 3CX desktop application software last month was facilitated by another 
            software supply chain breach targeting X_TRADER in 2022. The sprawling interlinked attack appears to have substantial 
            overlap with previous North Korea-aligned groups and campaigns that have historically targeted cryptocurrency companies 
            and conducted financially motivated attacks.
