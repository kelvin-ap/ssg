            The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added three actively exploited vulnerabilities to its Known 
            Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. The flaws include a MinIO information disclosure vulnerability, a PaperCut MF/NG improper 
            access control vulnerability, and a Google Chrome Skia integer overflow vulnerability. The vulnerabilities have been exploited by 
            threat actors from several countries. CISA has recommended that Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies remediate the 
            vulnerabilities by May 12, 2023, to secure their networks against active threats.

            The PaperCut print management software vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and run arbitrary code, 
            and evidence of active exploitation of unpatched servers emerged in the wild around April 18, 2023. The Skia 2D graphics library 
            vulnerability in Google Chrome could allow a threat actor to perform a sandbox escape via a crafted HTML page. The MinIO vulnerability 
            could result in information disclosure, and a reference implementation provided by OpenAI for developers to integrate their plugins 
            to ChatGPT relied on an older version of MinIO that's vulnerable to the flaw.
