            A large-scale attack campaign discovered in the wild has been exploiting Kubernetes (K8s) Role-Based Access 
            Control (RBAC) to create backdoors and run cryptocurrency miners. Cloud security firm Aqua said it found 60 
            exposed K8s clusters that have been exploited by the threat actor behind this campaign. The attack chain 
            commenced with the attacker gaining initial access via a misconfigured API server, followed by checking for 
            evidence of competing miner malware on the compromised server and then using RBAC to set up persistence.

          <p>
            The final step of the attack entailed the threat actor creating a DaemonSet to deploy a container image 
            hosted on Docker ("kuberntesio/kube-controller:1.0.1") on all nodes. The container, which has been pulled 
            14,399 times since its upload five months ago, harbors a cryptocurrency miner. Interestingly, some of the 
            tactics described in the campaign bear similarities to another illicit cryptocurrency mining operation 
            that also took advantage of DaemonSets to mint Dero and Monero.
