            Google has patched a zero-day flaw in its cloud platform that could have allowed cybercriminals to conceal an 
            unremovable malicious application in a victim's account. Researchers from Israeli cybersecurity start-up Astrix 
            Security discovered the GhostToken flaw, which affected all Google accounts including Workspace accounts, and 
            reported it to Google on June 19, 2022. The flaw enabled attackers to gain permanent and unremovable access to 
            victims' Google accounts by transforming an already authorised third-party application into a malicious trojan 
            app, leaving the victim's personal data exposed forever. Google issued a patch globally on April 7, 2023.

            The flaw involved deleting the Google Cloud Platform project linked to the authorised OAuth app, which then 
            went into a "pending deletion" state. The attacker could then make the rogue app visible again and use the 
            access token to extract the victim's data, deleting the project and making it invisible once again. Google's 
            patch now displays apps in a pending deletion state on the third-party access page, enabling users to revoke 
            any permissions granted to such apps.
